# Jumpedia
Jumpedia is a discord bot intended developed for the Super Mario Odyssey Trickjumping Community. It has features to get information about all jumps that are stored, a possibility to store the jumps one has completed and many other features. 

Jumpedia is a universal bot, meaning that all jumps stored are static and are only changeable by Jumpedia staff, not by staff of servers the bot is on. If a jump is not stored in Jumpedia yet, it can be submitted to the Trickjump Database (https://discord.gg/cJnFmM6bjD) and it will be added as soon as possible!

A guide on how to use the bot can be found on the pastebin: https://pastebin.com/4CPm8PH2

Features & bugfixes planned already (importance from top down):
- Database jump adding feature via commands
- "Missing" command
- Support for multiple locations, founders, provers & tasers for single jump
- Fix some remaining data issues and inconsistencies
- Leaderboard
- Way to give a list of jumps at once
- Slash commands
- More I need to still think about

If a bug occurrs or the bot behaves not as intended, I will get pinged if I am on the server, otherwise DM me (JoniKauf) or open a new issue on this repository! For any feature requests, open a new issue or DM me on discord!
